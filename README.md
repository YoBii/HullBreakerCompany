# CREATING CUSTOM EVENT 

#### After v1.3.0 events may not work, you need to add `SpawnableOutsideEnemies = off` to your cfg

For now, custom events support only mode when you increase enemy spawn rate, but in the next update i will add more modes & functions. 

How can I create custom event?

1. Create new folder in `\Lethal Company\BepInEx\HullEvents` 
2. In folder create `.cfg` file with name of event, like `CrawlerEvent.cfg`
3. In `{NameEvent}.cfg` file write like this:
```cfg
[CustomEvent]

EventID = Crawler

EventWeight = 10

InGameMessage = Crawlers coming

InGameShortMessage = CRAWLER

SpawnableEnemies = crawler,hoarderbug

EnemyRarity = 128
```

`EventID` - ID of event, must be unique

`EventWeight` - Weight of event, its default value, you can change later in HullBreaker.cfg after event creation

`InGameMessage` - Message that will be printed in chat when event starts

`InGameShortMessage` - Short message, when short mode is on

`SpawnableEnemies` - Enemies that will be spawned, on your event, enemies must be in list down below, without quotes, separated by commas
```c#
SpawnableEnemies
    
{ "flowerman",}, // https://lethal.miraheze.org/wiki/Bracken
{ "hoarderbug",}, // https://lethal.miraheze.org/wiki/Hoarding_Bug
